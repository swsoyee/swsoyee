`{r3dmol}` v0.1.2 is now available on CRAN. 
By using `{r3dmol}`, you could create rich and fully interactive 3D visualizations of molecular data, and embed pdbs easily into a rmarkdown report or blogdown post.

Some powerful features are introduced from v0.1.2.

## 1. Convert Widget to PNG

Some times you may not need an interactive widget or just want to reduce the size of the document, then you can use `m_png` to quickly convert the widget to a PNG image (base64 encoded).

```{r png}
library(r3dmol)

r3dmol() %>%
  m_add_model(data = pdb_1j72, format = "pdb") %>%
  m_set_style(style = m_style_cartoon()) %>%
  m_zoom_to() %>%
  m_png(width = 800)
```

## 2. Quickly View Given Structure

From v0.1.2, `m_glimpse()` has been added to create a scene with a number of simple defaults in order to quickly view the structure without having to write multiple lines of code.

```{r glimpse()}
m_glimpse(model = "4ozs", spin = TRUE)
```

## 3. Multiple Selections

Please refer to this article ([Dealing with multiple selections to speed up adding lines & shapes.
](https://swsoyee.github.io/r3dmol/articles/multi-selections.html)) to see more details.

## 4. Multiple Viewers

You could create and initialize an appropriate a grid of viewers that share a WebGL canvas from v0.1.2

```{r multiple viewers}
library(r3dmol)

m1 <- r3dmol() %>%
  m_add_model(data = pdb_6zsl, format = "pdb") %>%
  m_zoom_to()

m2 <- m1 %>%
  m_set_style(style = m_style_cartoon(color = "spectrum"))

m3 <- m1 %>%
  m_set_style(style = m_style_stick())

m4 <- m1 %>%
  m_set_style(style = m_style_sphere())

m_grid(
  viewer = list(m1, m2, m3, m4),
  control_all = TRUE,
  viewer_config = m_viewer_spec(
    backgroundColor = "black"
  )
)
```

## 5. Button

Add `m_button()` function to support adding custom features in the viewer, 
such as switching the style of the model, etc.

<div class="alert warning">
Unfortunately, if you want to use buttons in Rmarkdown, there is a bug where the buttons are not set in the correct position.  
It has been fixed in the development version, but since the CRAN package is not allowed to be updated too often, the fix will be added in a v0.1.3.  
If you really need to use this feature now, we recommend you to install the development version from Github.
</div>

```{r button}
r3dmol() %>%
  m_add_model(data = pdb_1j72, format = "pdb") %>%
  m_zoom_to() %>%
  m_button(
    name = "cartoon",
    label = "Cartoon",
    align_items = "flex-end",
    justify_content = "center",
    func = "
      function() {
        viewer.setStyle({cartoon:{}});
        viewer.render();
      }
    "
  ) %>%
  m_button(
    name = "stick",
    label = "Stick",
    func = "
      function() {
        viewer.setStyle({stick:{}});
        viewer.render();
      }
    "
  )

```
